# openssl-dockerfiles

Dockerfiles and images (on GHCR) for a few versions of OpenSSL.

These builds are not suitable for production use. They are for testing
purposes. If you use them in production, you will have a very bad time.

The Dockerfiles themselves are licensed under Apache 2.0.

OpenSSL is licensed under the [OpenSSL License](https://spdx.org/licenses/OpenSSL.html)
